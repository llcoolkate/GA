         <p> The river city is full of gems when it comes to local eateries. Here is a list of my current favorite restaurants in town.</p>
     <article class="restaurant">
         <h2># 7: Katie's Pizza and Pasta Osteria (Rock Hill)</h2>
      <h3><a href="https://katiespizzaandpasta.com/"> katiespizzaandpasta.com</a></h3>
      <img src="images\KatiesPatio_1600x.webp" alt="Katie's patio" width="900" height="">
         <p> 
            Katie’s Pizza on Manchester Road in Rock Hill is in a strip mall that is also home to a Tuesday Morning and a Massage LuXe. Just the location would be a deal breaker for most other restaurants but when you walk in to Katie’s it’s really its own universe: the lighting is soft and inviting, the movie playing behind the bar is always something familiar, . The best part, by far, is the food. Inventive and classic at the same time, Katie Collier and her team create antipasti, burrata, pizza, and pastas that are just, I don’t know, comforting and good. Katie’s is the place I go when I have had a bad day or when I have earned a good dinner. I recommend the Fiori Arrabiata (I add chicken), and the EZZO Pepperoni Pizza.

      <h2> # 6: Tacos La Jefa (Dutchtown) </h2>
      <h3> </h3>
      <img src="images\TacosLaJefa.jpg" alt="Tacos La Jefa menu items" width="900" height="">
         <p>
            Urban Eats in Dutchtown is a neighborhood food hall that houses the iconic Tacos La Jefa. Opened by Heriberta Amescua, La Jefa herself, and her family in September of 2020, this small taco spot with a very
            limited menu has been a source of joy for south city carnivores during uncertain times. I recommend
            getting anything and dipping whatever form of birria you’d like and dunking it in the consomme before each bite. It’s that consomme or broth that made me fall in love with La Jefa. For a perfect autumn afternoon, pick up a meal for two at Tacos La Jefa and head to a picnic table in nearby Carondolet Park.

      <h2># 5: Tumeric (Loop/Midtown)</h2>
      <h3></h3>
      <img src="images\tumeric.jpg" alt="plates at Tumeric" width="900" height="">
         <p>
            When I say Tumeric has the best specials, I mean I have dreams about their specials. I have literally danced between bites eating dosas and rice bowls from their location in the Foundry Food Hall in Mid Town, Tumeric Street Style. Just thinking about their Andhra Chilli Chicken, I am suddenly starving. Their Tikka Masala is a great place to start but do yourself a favor and get whatever pan-Indian dish they recommend. I once ordered a chicken Tikka bowl and the gentleman taking my order asked if I would like to try something else and I instinctively said I would and whatever they gave me instead was amazing.

      <h2># 4: Vicia (CWE) </h2>
      <h3></h3>
      <img src="images\20170718_Vicia_0261.jpg" alt="dishes from Vicia" width="900" height="">
         <p> 
            Vicia is the restaurant that I used to lovingly refer to as my boyfriend. One of the first places in town I
            took my now husband when we started dating was Vicia. For the last 5 years, Vicia is where I have demanded to go for any family dinner, birthday dinner, or whenever someone else was paying for dinner. Their vegetable forward menu lets you eat without feeling gross afterwards. Their cocktails and mocktails are delicious and light. The whole experience is always lovely. The food is all locally sourced, and you can often see local farmers deliver their crates of vegetables to the kitchen. Just do the tasting menu, look forward to the tacos, which are crisp, fresh, and creative.

      <h2># 3: Elia (botanical heights)</h2>
      <h3></h3>
      <img src="images\ELAIA-2021.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="">
         <p> 
            Elia is one of the killer restaurants at that botanical heights street corner where everything is just absolutely good. This tasting menu is worthy of a Michelin star or two easily. The food is from everywhere, and perfect. It is an experience that I now realize I miss terribly. Each course is exciting and lovely to look at but their soup courses are usually strikingly pleasing. It is like eating at your coolest friend’s home, if they happened to be a world-class chef.

      <h2># 2: Private Kitchen/ Soup Dumpling STL (U. City) </h2>
      <h3></h3>
      <img src="images\112817_soupdumpling2.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="">
         <p>
            I do not even know where to start. The experience is a little different from other restaurants in town.
            First, you call ahead to schedule the reservation and let them know what you would like. Some dishes
            are only available if you order a week or two in advance. When you arrive for your reservation, you are
            seated and they start the evening. There are 4 tables in their intimate location off Olive, it is a unique
            and intimate experience each time you dine with them. The food itself is beautiful and unforgettable.
            You must get any dumplings they have on the menu but aside from that, you cannot go wrong with
            anything they offer.

      <h2># 1: Bullrush (Midtown)</h2>
      <h3></h3>
      <img src="images\Bulrush.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600">
         <p> 
            Truly the nerdiest restaurant in town. Bulrush offers a few different dining experiences. You can chose
            to sit at the bar for a less intense evening or join Chef Rob in the main dining room for the tasting menu.
            I recommend the latter option. The menu is constantly changing with the seasons and every dish is rooted in the historical traditions of the Ozark region. They are lovely and accommodating and honestly excited about what they are serving. When you dine at Bulrush you get a little anthropology, a little food science, a little agricultural and foraging lesson. You will leave in awe of Chef Rob and his team and with an appreciation for this bountiful place that we are lucky enough to call home.
